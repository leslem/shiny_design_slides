## HTML (1993)

- HTML = "HyperText Markup Language"
- Markup language = formatting and structure information embedded into text
  - others include LaTeX, XML, markdown
- [My favorite HTML resource](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
- Using Word docs as a metaphor, HTML is the separation of text/content into different groupings: titles, headings, tables, sections, images, etc.
- Build a web site with only HTML
- HTML 5 vs. older versions


## CSS (1996)

- CSS = "Cascading Style Sheets"
- Language to define styles -- separate content and presentation
- [My favorite CSS resource](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
- Using Word docs as a metaphor, CSS is the definition a style for each kind of content grouping: table style, title style, paragraph style, etc.
- Build a web site with HTML + CSS


## Boostrap (2011)

- [My favorite Bootstrap resource](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ver.asp)
- [Official Boostrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com)

- Build a web site with HTML + Boostrap CSS etc.


## Bootstrap and Shiny

- [Masthing Shiny chapter 8](https://mastering-shiny.org/action-layout.html#bootstrap)


## `bslib`

- 
- [`bslib` documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/index.html)
- [Towards the next gen. of Shiny UI (talk by Carson Sievert)](https://youtu.be/ZIIH8WBHlLc)


## Build a Shiny app *without* Bootstrap or any built in CSS

- [RStudio article](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/html-ui.html)
- Why would you want to do this?
  - Make your Shiny app look like one page integrated into a production-grade, professionally designed web site
  - You already know CSS and the Shiny defaults just keep getting in your way
  - You like extra work??? `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`


## Browsers are weird

- Every web browser uses its own code base to parse and process HTML, CSS, etc.
- 
- Web browsers use their own style sheets! [Demo here](https://browserdefaultstyles.com/)
- 



## Using your browser's inspector

- Safari:
- Chrome: 
- Edge:
